# Raspberry Pi Chat (Python)

Python version of - https://github.com/chasedickerson/raspberry-pi-chat-java

A simple Python-based chat application designed for Raspberry Pi, enabling real-time messaging over a local network. This project demonstrates core networking concepts in Python and is ideal for learning, tinkering, or building lightweight chat systems on Raspberry Pi devices.

## Context

While working and developing on my personal raspberry pi, I noticed the built in browser (Chromium), had trouble loading sites that I often visit for programming resouces (stackoverflow, git repos, documentation, and especially chatgpt). This made it difficult to find code examples and paste them directly into my IDE on the raspberry pi. I developed this application to assist with this issue. 

Using my personal mac, I am able to utilize chatgpt and other sites to get code snippets and examples, and paste them directly in the chat application to then copy the contents on my raspberry pi.

## Demo

Simply run the application on your personal development machine, open up this link in your raspberry pi (http://{your development machine's IP address}:5001), and send messages, files, and screenshots back and forth!

To send code snippets and retain code format, send the code block in inside 3 opening and closing back tick (```) statement 

Here is an example of how it works:

And click send

You can upload files and send screenshots as well using the Upload File feature 
(Note: create an uploads folder in the root directory for this to work as it isn't tracked by git)
